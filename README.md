# ●ABSTRACT

In this project, four different departments of electronics engineering, embedded system, design and consumer gathered to carry out the fusion project.

First, We set up a target with the consumer department and conducted a market research for a month.

Based on market research, We thought about what kind of creative app we would like to create. 

As a result, We implemented the following app. 

Our app is that connects between a part-time student and a store manager. 
The main functions are divided into five categories: 1. Schedule 2. Communication 3. Wage 4. Education 5. Protection.




# ●Initial Market Research PLAN
------------------------------------

**We planned how to conduct market research and questionnaire.**

# ●Problems with SIMILAR APPS
------------------------------------------

**We have investigated the problems of existing market apps in order to differentiate the existing apps from our apps.**

# ●DESIGN
-------------------------------------

**FINAL DESIGN we used**


*The part-time and store managers seem to be paired with each other on an equal footing.*

*The colors used are complementary red and green and do not match well.*

*However, we use a soft tint of pastel tones to create a fused feeling of this color.*

Some of the key features could not be implemented due to project submission deadlines.

The technologies implemented so far are as described above, and the rest of the implementation will be completed later.



***
We are preparing for the APP Challenge tournament and will only release Java code. It's not completely implemented yet, so I will make it a perfect app!
