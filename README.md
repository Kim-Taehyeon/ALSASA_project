# ●ABSTRACT

In this project, four different departments of electronics engineering, embedded system, design and consumer gathered to carry out the fusion project.

First, We set up a target with the consumer department and conducted a market research for a month.

Based on market research, We thought about what kind of creative app we would like to create. 

As a result, We implemented the following app. 

Our app is that connects between a part-time student and a store manager. 
The main functions are divided into five categories: 1. Schedule 2. Communication 3. Wage 4. Education 5. Protection.




# ●Initial Market Research PLAN
------------------------------------

**We planned how to conduct market research and questionnaire.**

# ●Problem DEFINITION
------------------------------------

**Based on market research, we have defined the problem which apps can help our target audience.**
**We divided the problem definition into six keywords(Schedule, Wage, Commute, Communication, Education, Protective means ).**

**< Definition of Problems for STORE MANAGERS >**

*1. Sudden change of schedule.*

*2. Decrease visibility when writing handwriting.*

*3. In case of many part-time worker in store, it is difficult to check salary.*

*4. mutual pay calculation amount is different.*

*5. Part-time student did not check the notice carefully.*

*6. Same contents, repetitive education.*

*7. There are limited protection measures for self-employed compared to large corporations or part-time workers.*








**< Definition of Problems for PART-TIME-STUDENTS >**

*1. Modified schedule not shared.*

*2. The hassle of writing for commute check.*

*3. If all the part-time work schedules are not shared, it is difficult to find a substitute.*

*4. Difficulty mentioning salary when working overtime.*

*5. Too many chat rooms.*

*6. It is burdensome to share contacts with other part-time students.*

*7. It is difficult to ask again contents of the store management training that we already learned.*

*8. They do not know what to do if they do something unfair while working part time.*

# ●Problems with SIMILAR APPS
------------------------------------------

**We have investigated the problems of existing market apps in order to differentiate the existing apps from our apps.**

*1. CUPANG_FC APP : Only commute management is possible.*

*2. ALBAM APP : Part-time-students need to run the app every time they commute.*
               *For Part-time-students, there is no function other than work record(Features focused only on store managers).*
               *There are separate apps for part-time apps and store managers.*

*3. PAYDAY APP : You have to write the settings manually.*
                *Pay_Calculator_input is inconvenient to use because input space is small.*

# ●PROTOTYPE
------------------------------------

**< PROTOTYPE for design >**

*We have created a variety of app design prototypes*

# ●DESIGN
-------------------------------------

**< FINAL DESIGN we used >**


*The part-time and store managers seem to be paired with each other on an equal footing.*

*The colors used are complementary red and green and do not match well.*

*However, we use a soft tint of pastel tones to create a fused feeling of this color.*

**▶ Some of the key features could not be implemented due to project submission deadlines.**

**▶ The technologies implemented so far are as described above, and the rest of the implementation will be completed later.**






***
We are preparing for the APP Challenge tournament and will only release Java code.
It's not completely implemented yet, so I will make it a perfect APP.
